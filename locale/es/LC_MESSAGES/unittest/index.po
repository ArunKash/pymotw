"Python's :mod:`unittest` module, sometimes referred to as PyUnit, is based "
"on the XUnit framework design by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma. The same pattern"
" is repeated in many other languages, including C, perl, Java, and "
"Smalltalk. The framework implemented by :mod:`unittest` supports fixtures, "
"test suites, and a test runner to enable automated testing for your code."

"Tests, as defined by :mod:`unittest`, have two parts: code to manage test "
"\"fixtures\", and the test itself. Individual tests are created by "
"subclassing :class:`TestCase` and overriding or adding appropriate methods. "
"For example,"

":func:`fail*()` and :func:`assert*()` methods all accept an argument *msg*, "

" author and the desired outcome of the code being tested. If the code "
"produces a value which can be evaluated as true, the methods "
":func:`failUnless()` and :func:`assertTrue()` should be used. If the code "
"produces a false value, the methods :func:`failIf()` and "

" you want the test to verify that some code does produce an exception. For "
"example, if an invalid value is given to an attribute of an object. In such "

"the exception yourself. Compare these two tests:"

"Fixtures are resources needed by a test. For example, if you are writing "
"several tests for the same class, those tests all need an instance of that "
"class to use for testing. Other test fixtures include database connections "
"and temporary files (many people would argue that using external resources "
"makes such tests not \"unit\" tests, but they are still tests and still "
"useful).  :class:`TestCase` includes a special hook to configure and clean "
"up any fixtures needed by your tests. To configure the fixtures, override "
":func:`setUp()`. To clean up, override :func:`tearDown()`."

"The standard library documentation describes how to organize test suites "

"build the suites automatically (these are automated tests, after all).  "
"Automating the construction of test suites is especially useful for large "
"code bases, in which related tests are not all in the same place. Tools such"
" as nose make it easier to manage tests when they are spread over multiple "
"files and directories."
