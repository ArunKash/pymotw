msgid ""
"A double-ended queue, or :class:`deque`, supports adding and removing "
"elements from either end. The more commonly used stacks and queues are "
"degenerate forms of deques, where the inputs and outputs are restricted to a"
" single end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:16
msgid ""
"Since deques are a type of sequence container, they support some of the same"
" operations that lists support, such as examining the contents with "
":func:`__getitem__`, determining length, and removing elements from the "
"middle by matching identity."

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:40
msgid ""
"A deque can be populated from either end, termed \"left\" and \"right\" in "
"the Python implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:47
msgid ""
"Notice that :func:`extendleft` iterates over its input and performs the "
"equivalent of an :func:`appendleft` for each item. The end result is the "
":class:`deque` contains the input sequence in reverse order."

msgid "Consuming"
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:69
msgid ""
"Similarly, the elements of the :class:`deque` can be consumed from both or "
"either end, depending on the algorithm being applied."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:76
msgid ""
"Use :func:`pop` to remove an item from the \"right\" end of the "
":class:`deque` and :func:`popleft` to take from the \"left\" end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:96
msgid ""
"Since deques are thread-safe, the contents can even be consumed from both "
"ends at the same time from separate threads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:103
msgid ""
"The threads in this example alternate between each end, removing items until"
" the :class:`deque` is empty."

msgid "Rotating"
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:127
msgid ""
"Another useful capability of the :class:`deque` is to rotate it in either "
"direction, to skip over some items."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:134
msgid ""
"Rotating the :class:`deque` to the right (using a positive rotation) takes "
"items from the right end and moves them to the left end. Rotating to the "
"left (with a negative value) takes items from the left end and moves them to"
" the right end.  It may help to visualize the items in the deque as being "
"engraved along the edge of a dial."
