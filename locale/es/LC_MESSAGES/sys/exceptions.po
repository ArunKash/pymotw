"Many applications are structured with a main loop that wraps execution in a "
"global exception handler to trap errors not handled at a lower level.  "
"Another way to achieve the same thing is by setting the "
":data:`sys.excepthook` to a function that takes three arguments (error type,"
" error value, and traceback) and let it deal with unhandled errors."

"There are times when an explicit exception handler is preferred, either for "
"code clarity or to avoid conflicts with libraries that try to install their "
"own excepthook.  In these cases you may want to write a common handler "
"function, but avoid passing the exception object to it explicitly.  You can "
"get the current exception for a thread by calling :func:`exc_info`."

msgid ""
"The return value of :func:`exc_info` is a three member tuple containing the "
"exception class, an exception instance, and a traceback.  Using "
":func:`exc_info` is preferred over the old form (with :const:`exc_type`, "
":const:`exc_value`, and :const:`exc_traceback`) because it is thread-safe."

"This example avoids introducing a circular reference between the traceback "
"object and a local variable in the current frame by ignoring that part of "
"the return value from :func:`exc_info`.  If the traceback is needed (e.g., "
"so it can be logged), explicitly delete the local variable (using "
":command:`del`) to avoid cycles."

"In the interactive interpreter, there is only one thread of interaction.  "
"Unhandled exceptions in that thread are saved to three variables in "
":mod:`sys` (:const:`last_type`, :const:`last_value`, and "
":const:`last_traceback`) to make it easy to retrieve them for debugging.  "
"Using the post-mortem debugger in :mod:`pdb` avoids any need to use the "
"values directly."
