msgid ""
"The string class is the most obvious text processing tool available to "
"Python programmers, but there are plenty of other tools in the standard "
"library to make text manipulation simpler."

msgid ""
"Old-style code will use functions from the :mod:`string` module, instead of "
"methods of string objects.  There is an equivalent method for each function "
"from the module, and use of the functions is deprecated for new code."

"Newer code may use a ``string.Template`` as a simple way to parameterize "
"strings beyond the features of the string or unicode classes.  While not as "
"feature-rich as templates defined by many of the web frameworks or extension"
" modules available on PyPI, ``string.Template`` is a good middle ground for "
"user-modifiable templates where dynamic values need to be inserted into "
"otherwise static text."

"Reading from a file is easy enough, but if you're writing a line-by-line "
"filter the :mod:`fileinput` module is even easier.  The fileinput API calls "
"for you to iterate over the ``input()`` generator, processing each line as "
"it is yielded.  The generator handles parsing command line arguments for "
"file names, or falling back to reading directly from ``sys.stdin``.  The "
"result is a flexible tool your users can run directly on a file or as part "
"of a pipeline."

"The :mod:`textwrap` module includes tools for formatting text from "
"paragraphs by limiting the width of output, adding indentation, and "
"inserting line breaks to wrap lines consistently."

msgid "Comparing Values"
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/articles/text_processing.rst:29
msgid ""
"The standard library includes two modules related to comparing text values "
"beyond the built-in equality and sort comparison supported by string "
"objects.  :mod:`re` provides a complete regular expression library, "
"implemented largely in C for performance.  Regular expressions are well-"
"suited for finding substrings within a larger data set, comparing strings "
"against a pattern (rather than another fixed string), and mild parsing."

":mod:`difflib`, on the other hand, shows you the actual differences between "
"sequences of text in terms of the parts added, removed, or changed.  The "
"output of the comparison functions in :mod:`difflib` can be used to provide "
"more detailed feedback to user about where changes occur in two inputs, how "
"a document has changed over time, etc."
