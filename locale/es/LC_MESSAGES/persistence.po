"The standard library includes a variety of modules for persisting data.  The"
" most common pattern for storing data from Python objects for reuse is to "
"serialize them with :mod:`pickle` and then either write them directly to a "
"file or store them using one of the many key-value pair database formats "
"available with the *dbm* API.  If you don't care about the underlying dbm "
"format, the best persistence interface is provided by :mod:`shelve`.  If you"
" do care, you can use one of the other dbm-based modules directly."

"For serializing over the web, the :mod:`json` module may be a better choice "
"since its format is more portable."
