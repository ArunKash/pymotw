"Functional programming using iterators occasionally requires creating small "
"functions for simple expressions. Sometimes these can be expressed as lambda"
" functions, but some operations do not need to be implemented with custom "
"functions at all. The :mod:`operator` module defines functions that "
"correspond to built-in operations for arithmetic and comparison, as well as "
"sequence and dictionary operations."

":func:`not_` includes the trailing underscore because :command:`not` is a "

"expression in an :command:`if` statement.  :func:`is_` implements the same "
"check used by the :command:`is` keyword, and :func:`is_not` does the same "
"test and returns the opposite answer."
