"The most basic starting point in the profile module is ``run()``.  It takes "
"a string statement as argument, and creates a report of the time spent "
"executing different lines of code while running the statement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/profile/index.rst:29
msgid ""
"This recursive version of a fibonacci sequence calculator [#fibonacci]_ is "
"especially useful for demonstrating the profile because we can improve the "
"performance so much.  The standard report format shows a summary and then "
"details for each function executed."

#: ../../PyMOTW/profile/index.rst:55
msgid ""
"As you can see, it takes 57356 separate function calls and 3/4 of a second "
"to run.  Since there are only 66 *primitive* calls, we know that the vast "
"majority of those 57k calls were recursive.  The details about where time "
"was spent are broken out by function in the listing showing the number of "
"calls, total time spent in the function, time per call (tottime/ncalls), "
"cumulative time spent in a function, and the ratio of cumulative time to "
"primitive calls."

"Not surprisingly, most of the time here is spent calling ``fib()`` "
"repeatedly.  We can add a memoize decorator [#memoize]_ to reduce the number"
" of recursive calls and have a big impact on the performance of this "
"function."

"By remembering the Fibonacci value at each level we can avoid most of the "
"recursion and drop down to 145 calls that only take 0.003 seconds. Also "
"notice that the ncalls count for ``fib()`` shows that it *never* recurses."

"The standard report created by the :mod:`profile` functions is not very "
