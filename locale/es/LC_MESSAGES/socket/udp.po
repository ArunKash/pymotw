"The user datagram protocol (UDP) works differently from TCP/IP.  Where TCP "
"is a *stream oriented* protocol, ensuring that all of the data is "
"transmitted in the right order, UDP is a *message oriented* protocol. UDP "
"does not require a long-lived connection, so setting up a UDP socket is a "
"little simpler.  On the other hand, UDP messages must fit within a single "
"packet (for IPv4, that means they can only hold 65,507 bytes because the "
"65,535 byte packet also includes header information) and delivery is not "
"guaranteed as it is with TCP."

"Since there is no connection, per se, the server does not need to listen for"
" and accept connections.  It only needs to use :func:`bind` to associate its"
" socket with a port, and then wait for individual messages."

"Messages are read from the socket using :func:`recvfrom`, which returns the "
"data as well as the address of the client from which it was sent."

msgid ""
"The UDP echo client is similar the server, but does not use :func:`bind` to "
"attach its socket to an address.  It uses :func:`sendto` to deliver its "
"message directly to the server, and :func:`recvfrom` to receive the "
"response."
