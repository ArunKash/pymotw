"Sockets transmit streams of bytes.  Those bytes can contain text messages, "
"as in the previous examples, or they can be made up of binary data that has "
"been encoded for transmission.  To prepare binary data values for "
"transmission, pack them into a buffer with :mod:`struct`."

"This client program encodes an integer, a string of two characters, and a "
"floating point value into a sequence of bytes that can be passed to the "
"socket for transmission."

"The floating point value loses some precision as it is packed and unpacked, "
"but otherwise the data is transmitted as expected.  One thing to keep in "
"mind is that depending on the value of the integer, it may be more efficient"
" to convert it to text and then transmit, instead of using :mod:`struct`.  "
"The integer ``1`` uses one byte when represented as a string, but four when "
"packed into the structure."
