"Point-to-point connections handle a lot of communication needs, but passing "
"the same information between many peers becomes challenging as the number of"
" direct connections grows.  Sending messages separately to each recipient "
"consumes additional processing time and bandwidth, which can be a problem "
"for applications such as streaming video or audio.  Using *multicast* to "
"deliver messages to more than one endpoint at a time achieves better "
"efficiency because the network infrastructure ensures that the packets are "
"delivered to all recipients."

"Multicast messages are always sent using UDP, since TCP requires an end-to-"
"end communication channel.  The addresses for multicast, called *multicast "
"groups*, are a subset of regular IPv4 address range (224.0.0.0 through "
"230.255.255.255) reserved for multicast traffic. These addresses are treated"
" specially by network routers and switches, so messages sent to the group "
"can be distributed over the Internet to all recipients that have joined the "
"group."

"Some managed switches and routers have multicast traffic disabled by "

"This modified echo client will send a message to a multicast group, then "
"report all of the responses it receives.  Since it has no way of knowing how"
" many responses to expect, it uses a timeout value on the socket to avoid "
"blocking indefinitely waiting for an answer."

"The socket also needs to be configured with a *time-to-live* value (TTL) for"
" the messages.  The TTL controls how many networks will receive the packet."
"  Set the TTL with the :const:`IP_MULTICAST_TTL` option and "
":func:`setsockopt`.  The default, ``1``, means that the packets are not "
"forwarded by the router beyond the current network segment.  The value can "
"range up to 255, and should be packed into a single byte."

"The rest of the sender looks like the UDP echo client, except that it "

"After the regular socket is created and bound to a port, it can be added to "
"the multicast group by using :func:`setsockopt` to change the "
":const:`IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` option.  The option value is the 8-byte packed "
"representation of the multicast group address followed by the network "
"interface on which the server should listen for the traffic, identified by "
"its IP address.  In this case, the receiver listens on all interfaces using "
":const:`INADDR_ANY`."
