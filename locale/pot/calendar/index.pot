The weekheader(), monthcalendar(), and yeardays2calendar() methods of Calendar are especially useful for that sort of work."

For example, the Python Atlanta User's Group meets the 2nd Thursday of every month. To calculate the dates for the meetings for a year, you could use the return value of monthcalendar()."
