msgid "A double-ended queue, or :class:`deque`, supports adding and removing elements from either end. The more commonly used stacks and queues are degenerate forms of deques, where the inputs and outputs are restricted to a single end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:16
# 5f830cc310d4497898c847546c7d1b7e
msgid "Since deques are a type of sequence container, they support some of the same operations that lists support, such as examining the contents with :func:`__getitem__`, determining length, and removing elements from the middle by matching identity."

msgid "A deque can be populated from either end, termed \"left\" and \"right\" in the Python implementation."
msgstr ""

# f9551b1595a44d5fb86b22e24760eb39
msgid "Notice that :func:`extendleft` iterates over its input and performs the equivalent of an :func:`appendleft` for each item. The end result is the :class:`deque` contains the input sequence in reverse order."

msgid "Similarly, the elements of the :class:`deque` can be consumed from both or either end, depending on the algorithm being applied."

msgid "Use :func:`pop` to remove an item from the \"right\" end of the :class:`deque` and :func:`popleft` to take from the \"left\" end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:96
# e188812f089a48fbb46c35fb2e181511
msgid "Since deques are thread-safe, the contents can even be consumed from both ends at the same time from separate threads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:103
# c4cf80b8e9be4f5b8036938b7355dd1f
msgid "The threads in this example alternate between each end, removing items until the :class:`deque` is empty."

msgid "Another useful capability of the :class:`deque` is to rotate it in either direction, to skip over some items."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/collections/deque.rst:134
# 3857ac0a69544ace981cfc6a8dc5a631
msgid "Rotating the :class:`deque` to the right (using a positive rotation) takes items from the right end and moves them to the left end. Rotating to the left (with a negative value) takes items from the left end and moves them to the right end.  It may help to visualize the items in the deque as being engraved along the edge of a dial."
