msgid "The function getstatusoutput() runs a command via the shell and returns the exit code and the text output (stdout and stderr combined). The exit codes are the same as for the C function wait() or os.wait(). The code is a 16-bit number. The low byte contains the signal number that killed the process. When the signal is zero, the high byte is the exit status of the program. If a core file was produced, the high bit of the low byte is set."

msgid "This example runs two commands that exit normally, a third meant to generate a core dump, and a fourth that blocks waiting to be killed from another shell. (Don't simply use Ctrl-C as the interpreter will intercept that signal. Use ps and grep in another window to find the read process and send it a signal with kill.)"
